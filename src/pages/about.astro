				Hi!
			</p>
			<p>Thanks for checking out my website. My name is Dennis and i am from Greece.
			</p>
			<p>
				Being a massive technology nerd, i was into computers from a very young age.
				When we started doing programming in school, it was easily my favourite subject.
				I love problem solving, what can i sayüòÅ
			</p>
			<p>
				So i decided to study Computer Science at Ionian University in Corfu. Where i learned a lot of different programming languages, programming theories, technologies and much more.
			</p>
			<p>
				So here I am, finally feeling confident enough in my skills to look for a job. Wish me luck! üòä
