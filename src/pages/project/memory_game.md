_You can find the code here[**frontend**](https://github.com/dtetradis/memory_game_frontend)_

One day, I found myself searching for an alternative to the basic iOS alarm in hopes of finding something that would help me wake up faster and feel more energized. I decided to try out Alarmy (which I highly recommend, though I eventually returned to the iOS alarm).

One of the features that caught my attention was a memory game designed to help users wake up. I thought it would be a great opportunity to practice and further develop my web development skills by creating something similar.

With a solid foundation in web development, I set out to build my own version of this memory game.
