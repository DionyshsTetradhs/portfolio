This Python-based RPG game's main objective is defeating all the bosses. The game's mechanic involves growing stronger by eliminating minions, which, in turn, makes it easier to defeat the bosses later on.

The primary motivation behind creating this project was to learn more about Python, making it an excellent educational endeavor.
