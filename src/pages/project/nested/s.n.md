Initially, I conceived the idea of creating a more user-friendly way to engage with social media. Inspired by my experience with Arch Linux and window managers, I aimed to develop a terminal-based interactive network or chat application.

In my pursuit of maximum interactivity, I began experimenting with Framer Motion. To my disappointment, it lacked the drag-and-drop functionality I envisioned. While I could potentially customize a Framer Motion element to support it, I opted for React Drag and Drop, which offered a smoother solution without significant complexity.

As my first full-stack project, I quickly realized the immense time and effort it would demand. To test my concept, I implemented essential features like real-time chat, posts, drag-and-drop capabilities, and user accounts. While the project has yet to reach the level I aspire to, I intend to revisit it in the future.

During the development of this project, I became acquainted with tools such as Next.js, Tailwind CSS, PrismaDB, and many more, which I found highly appealing.

Overall, this project proved to be a great learning experience.
